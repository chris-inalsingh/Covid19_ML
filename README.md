## COVID-19: Diagnosis and Vaccination
Efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 can reduce the transmission, thereby mitigating the burden on healthcare systems. Prediction models that combine several features can be used to estimate the risk of infection. Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from persons to person and may also vary in different age groups. Some of the commonly reported symptoms include:
* new or worsening cough
* shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
* temperature equal to or over 38Â°C
* feeling feverish
* chills
* fatigue or weakness
* muscle or body aches
* new loss of smell or taste
* headache
* gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)
* feeling very unwell

With the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine, we expect a decline in the future infections. But to what extent and when do we expect to see these changes? 
In this project, we will predict the diagnosis of COVID-19, and also predict the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine.

### Goals
a.  Using a data compilation of the symptoms recorded on testing, this analysis will use machine learning to:

1. Predict COVID-19 diagnosis given a panel of symptoms
2. Predict efficacy of vaccination based on vaccine rollout in some countries of the world.
3. Predict efficacy of vaccinnation based on vaccine rollout across Canada.

b. Visualizing the historical data and predictions in (a).
